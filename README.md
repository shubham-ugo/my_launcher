# My Launcher - README

This repository contains a launcher file for setting up a ROS environment with specific configurations and nodes. The launcher file is designed to perform the following tasks:
- Set the `robot_description` ROS parameter to the URDF file present in the `ngk_kart_desc` package.
- Launch the `joint_state_publisher_gui` node.
- Launch the `robot_state_publisher` node to obtain TF data.
- Launch the `rplidar_s2.launch` file from the `rplidar_ros` package.

## Usage
To use the launcher file and set up the ROS environment with the desired configurations, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd my_launcher
   ```

3. Launch the desired ROS setup using the launcher file:

   ```bash
   roslaunch my_launcher.launch
   ```

4. Monitor the ROS environment and verify that the `joint_state_publisher_gui` node, `robot_state_publisher` node, and `rplidar_s2.launch` file are running properly.
